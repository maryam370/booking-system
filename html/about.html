        <h1>About BookNest</h1>

        <h2>But First, Look Around</h2>
<p>Before diving into the development of BookNest, we explored existing library management systems to understand the market and identify gaps we could fill. Some well-known proprietary solutions include <a href="https://exlibrisgroup.com/alma" target="_blank">Alma by Ex Libris</a>, a cloud-based platform used by academic and research libraries, and <a href="https://www.iii.com/products/sierra/" target="_blank">Sierra ILS</a>, which offers advanced cataloging and circulation tools for larger institutions. These systems, while powerful, often come with high costs and limited customization options. BookNest, as an open-source alternative, aims to provide similar functionality without licensing fees, ensuring accessibility and flexibility for libraries of all sizes.</p>


        <h2>Starting from What You Have</h2>
        <p>BookNest began as a project in ITSE305, where we focused on building the core functionalities of a library system. The initial version, written in Java, included essential features such as searching for books, user login and signup, and basic book management. While functional, it lacked a user-friendly interface and was limited in scope. With BookNest, we expanded on these foundations by developing a web-based open source system, an improved UI, and support for multiple contributors, making it more scalable and collaborative.</p>

        <h2>Choose a Good Name</h2>
        <p>the name BookNest was chosen to reflect the system’s purpose—a place where books are collected, organized, and managed efficiently. "Nest" conveys a sense of structure and safekeeping, aligning with the goal of providing a well-organized library system. The name is simple, memorable, and clearly linked to books, making it easy for users to associate with a library management solution.

        </p>

        <h2>State That the Project is Free</h2>
        <p>BookNest is an open-source project released under the GNU General Public License (GPL). This means it's free to use, modify, and distribute, ensuring accessibility for libraries and institutions without licensing costs.
        </p>
