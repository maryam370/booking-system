# BookNest Participation Guidelines

Welcome to the **BookNest** development community! We appreciate your interest in contributing to our open-source library management system. Whether you're a developer, user, or library staff member, your contributions help make BookNest a better platform. These guidelines ensure a positive, inclusive, and efficient collaboration for everyone.

## 1. Code of Conduct & Best Practices

To maintain a respectful and productive community, all contributors are expected to follow our **Code of Conduct** and adhere to best practices:

- **Respectful Communication**: Always be polite and constructive when giving feedback or discussing issues. Everyone's contributions are valuable, and discussions should remain professional and inclusive.
- **Open & Welcoming Community**: BookNest is open to everyone—beginners and experienced contributors alike. Discrimination or harassment of any kind is not tolerated.
- **Best Practices**: Follow coding standards, document your work properly, and ensure your contributions align with the project’s goals.

## 2. Getting Started

- **Explore the Project**: Familiarize yourself with BookNest’s features and architecture by reviewing the documentation and project repository.
- **Clone the Repository**: Fork and clone the project from GitHub to start working locally.
- **Set Up Your Environment**: Follow the installation guide to configure the development environment properly.

### Branching Strategy
To keep development organized, always create a **new branch** for your work instead of making changes directly to the `main` branch.

- **Branch Naming Conventions:**
  - **Bug fixes:** `fix/loan-notification-bug`
  - **New features:** `feature/user-dashboard`
  - **Documentation updates:** `docs/update-installation-guide`

Once your changes are ready, push your branch to GitHub and open a **Pull Request (PR)** for review.

## 3. Reporting Issues

If you come across a **bug** or have a **feature suggestion**, we’d love to hear from you!

- **Before submitting**, check whether the issue has already been reported or discussed in GitHub Issues.
- **If the issue hasn’t been reported**, provide detailed information, including:
  - Steps to reproduce the problem.
  - Expected vs. actual behavior.
  - Screenshots or error messages (if applicable).
- **Use appropriate labels** such as `"bug," "enhancement,"` or `"documentation"` to categorize your issue properly.

## 4. Review Process

To maintain high standards, all contributions go through a **review process** before being merged into the project.

### Testing
- Before submitting, test your changes thoroughly to ensure they work correctly and don’t introduce new issues.

### Pull Requests (PRs)
- Open a **Pull Request** after testing your changes.
- Provide a clear description of the work done and reference relevant issues.
- Follow best practices in **HTML, CSS, Java**, or other languages used in the project.

### Code Reviews
- Your PR will be **reviewed by maintainers** or experienced contributors.
- Reviewers may provide feedback or request changes to ensure quality and consistency with project goals.

## 5. Documentation Contributions

Good documentation is essential for making BookNest accessible to all developers and users. Contributions to documentation are just as valuable as code contributions.

- **Improving Docs**: Update outdated, unclear, or missing documentation.
- **Code Documentation**: Add clear comments to explain your code's functionality.
- **User Guides & Tutorials**: Expand guides for setup, usage, and troubleshooting.
- **API Documentation**: Ensure APIs are well-documented for other developers.
